# CardGame
This is a card game that I learned how to play thanks to my friends in college. The overall purpose of the game is to get rid of all of your cards. There are some more complicated rules that I have yet to implement in regards to the facedown and faceup cards on the table.

This is also my first full project that I have implemented for fun outside of school.
